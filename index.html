            <p><i> Interesting facts about teddy-bears </i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a
                    1902 hunting trip.</li>
                <li>Inspired by a cartoon featuring the event, shopkeeper Morris Michtom and his wife Rose made a
                    stuffed bear with a sign ‘Teddy’s bear’ and left it in their shop window. It gained so much
                    attention that they started a successful toy making company.</li>
                <li>They aren’t just for children – 40% of teddy sales are for adults, and a quarter of us still has our
                    childhood companion.</li>

            <p><i> Interesting facts about </i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice
                    when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li>
                <li>The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus. (Females make a much
                    quieter sound by flicking their wings.) Cicadas don’t sing at night, so don’t blame them if you
                    can’t sleep.</li>
                <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the
                    lookout.</li>
